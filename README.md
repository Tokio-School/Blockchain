# Solidity - Ethereum

This is a project to test how the Solidity language is working.

There are implemented 2 different use cases in the project.
- Simple contract to deploy and play with a simple solidity contract
- Simple contracts related between them to work together

## Simple
This is a simple contract in solidity where the user can modify the message returned. It's a HelloWorld implementation.

## Remote
This is a project to understand how several contacts could work together as the Dapps are doing.
This example is a simple call from one of the contracts to the other one to count how many times the call has been triggered.
